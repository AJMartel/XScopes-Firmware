XScopes-Firmware
================

Source code for the XScopes:

    - Xprotolab
    - Xminilab
    - Xprotolab Portable
    - Xminilab Portable

The project is developed using Atmel Studio 6, available from atmel.com.

he XScopes are a combination of three electronic instruments: a mixed signal oscilloscope, an arbitrary waveform generator and a protocol sniffer. The XScopes can also be used as development boards for the AVR XMEGA microcontroller. The Xprotolab and Xminilab can be plugged directly on a breadboard.

Main Features:

    Mixed Signal Oscilloscope: Simultaneous sampling of 2 analog and 8 digital signals.
    Arbitrary Waveform Generator with advanced sweep options on all the wave parameters.
    Protocol Sniffer: SPI, I2C, UART
    Advanced Triggering System: Normal / Single / Auto / Free, with many trigger modes; adjustable trigger level, and ability to view signals prior to the trigger.
    Meter Mode: VDC, VPP and Frequency readout.
    XY Mode: For plotting Lissajous figures, V/I curves or checking the phase difference between two waveforms.
    Spectrum Analyzer with different windowing options and selectable vertical log and IQ visualization.
    Channel Math: add, multiply, invert, and average.
    Horizontal and Vertical Cursors with automatic waveform measurements, and waveform references.
    USB connectivity: Windows, Linux, MAC, Android
